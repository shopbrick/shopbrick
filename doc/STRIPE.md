# Stripe Integration Guide for ShopBrick 🧱🛒

This guide helps you configure and work with Stripe in your ShopBrick-powered storefront.

## 🧾 Purpose

ShopBrick uses Stripe to handle secure payment processing. Product data is exported into Stripe via API, and customer orders are recorded there directly — no backend required.

## 🔑 API Keys

- Get your **test keys** and **production keys** here:  
  [Stripe Test API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)

### Add them to your `config/secrets.yml`:

```yml
stripeApiSecretKey: 'sk_test_YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
stripeApiPublishableKey: 'pk_test_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY'
```

🧪 Use test keys during development and testing.  
🟢 Switch to live keys only when ready for production (can comment test keys, add prod keys, restart the server if needed).
